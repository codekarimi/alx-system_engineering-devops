#Hello World
#Confused smiley
#Let's display a file
#Last lines of a file
#I'd prefer the first ones actually
#Line #2
#It is a good file that cuts iron without making a noise
#Save current state of directory
#Duplicate last line
#No more javascript
#Don't just count your directories, make your directories count
#Whatâ€™s new
#Being unique is better than being perfect
#It must be in that file
#Count that word
#I hate bins
#Letters only please
#A to Z
#Without C, you would live in hiago
